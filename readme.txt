# Deep-Learning-HW2
The HW is composed of two parts, computational graph by scratch and (original/improved) LeNet5 model.

For the computational part, you can read backward.py directly.
The training/validation/testing are included in the backward.py file.

As for the LeNet5 model, you can see the folder LeNet5.
If you want to check the LeNet5 framework, please read model.py.
